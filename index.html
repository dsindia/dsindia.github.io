										</header>
										<p>We seek to further promote the interdisciplinary field of data science in India through outreach at secondary schools and universities. We hope to develop an awareness about data and its growing relevance, as well as an interest in pursuing and applying data science in the academic and professional worlds</p>

									<h2>Who We Are</h2>
								</header>

								<p> Based at UC Berkeley, we're a group of college students who are passionate about leveraging our technical skills as tools to make a concrete impact on the world around us. We're amazed by how data science is not only applicable to our fields of study, but an entirely new discipline in and of itself. Many of us have become a part of the growing data science community at Cal, through enrolling in and teaching classes, participating in research, and developing course material. </p>

								<p> We realized that students our age, even in some of India’s best universities, did not have an established track when it came to learning the subject. Moreover, we are appalled by the rampant structural inequalities in India when it comes to caste, religion, gender, and income, and have seen how communities at lower socioeconomic strata have been left behind when it comes to technological advancement. We are thus taking a step in the right direction to ensure that Indians from every background will be exposed to a plethora of opportunities available through technology, as well as contribute to India's rapid economic growth. </p>

									<h2>What We Do</h2>
								</header>
									<p style="color: #138808; font-weight: bold""> The Problem </p>
									<p> Data science has been hailed as one of the next big steps in the evolution of computing. Although there are significant data science opportunities in academia and industry in the West, the East lags far behind. India– a nation of 1.25 billion– has made rapid progress to become a major regional and global power, so citizens must be equipped with the tools to succeed in the 21st century. One key tool that develops skills necessary for success in any field is data science, and opportunities to pursue it at the undergraduate level and below are either scant or nonexistent. </p>
									<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #138808"> How We're Bridging the Gap </p>
									<p> Above all, Data Science for India seeks to build community. We seek to accomplish this through several means. </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Leverage Berkeley’s stellar technical programs with its commitment to social justice by developing a community of passionate students who seek to use their skills for the greater good</li>
										<li>Build interest in data science among students in Indian universities through serving as a resource for students to learn more about the field, apply it to their own majors and personal projects, or even pursue it as an occupation </li>
										<li>Empower Indian students in secondary schools who have some mathematical knowledge by teaching algorithmic methods of thinking and data literacy and connect them with students in universities</li>
									</ul>
									<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #138808"> What We're Working On </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Developing technical modules to be used at varying levels of education, from undergraduates with programming experience to students in government schools with little to no knowledge of programming and statistics. </li>
										<li> If schools do not have access to a computer, we will still teach lessons in the classroom. At the school level, data literacy is our objective and the programming exercises are meant to complement the conceptual lessons </li>
										<li> Connecting with students and faculty at various Indian institutions to establish data science-focused  organizations to teach these modules to students with limited programming experience and pursue initiatives to raise interest in data science at their universities </li>
									</ul>
									<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #138808"> Long Term Goals </p>
									<ul>
										<li> Connect with partners in the tech industry in both India and the US who share our vision of expanding access to a quality technical education </li>
										<li> Translating our modules into Indian languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, and Marathi to promote data <em> literacy </em> across India </li>
										<li> Exposing students with technical aptitude to more advanced concepts in fields such as machine learning </li>
										<li> Adapt our curriculum and outreach model to work with other nations to further our vision of a data literate society </li>
									</ul>
