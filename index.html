										<p>We seek to further promote the interdisciplinary field of data science in India through outreach at secondary schools and universities. We hope to develop an awareness about data and its growing relevance, as well as an interest in pursuing and applying data science in the academic and professional worlds.</p>

									<h2>Who We Are</h2>
								</header>

								<p>Founded at UC Berkeley, our organization has grown to include students from institutions around the world (Boston, London, Delhi, and Hong Kong, just to name a few) studying a diverse set of disciplines, ranging from computer science, math and engineering, to psychology, economics, and international relations. Just as the use of data unites the fields we pursue, we are united by a desire to spread our awareness of data to generate meaningful social change. </p>
								<p>Not only are we amazed by the ever-expanding variety of applications of data science, but also how it's an entirely new discipline itself. Many of our initial members have become a part of the growing data science community at Cal, through enrolling in and teaching classes, participating in research, and developing course material. </p>

								<p>We realized that many students our age, even in some of India’s best universities, did not have an established course of study or more importantly, a community to share their passion with, when it came to learning the subject. Moreover, we are appalled by the rampant structural inequalities in India regardless of their form: gender, religion, caste, and income, and have seen how communities at lower socioeconomic strata have been left behind in this era of technological advancement. We are thus taking a step in the right direction to ensure that Indians from every background will be exposed to a plethora of opportunities available through technology, appreciate interdisciplinary education, as well as contribute to India's rapid economic growth. </p>

									<h2>What We Do</h2>
								</header>
									<p style="color: #138808; font-weight: bold""> The Problem </p>
									<p>Data science has been hailed as one of the next big steps in the evolution of computing. Although there are significant opportunities to pursue data science in academia and industry in the West, the East lags far behind. India– a nation of 1.25 billion– has made rapid progress to become a major regional and global power, so citizens must be equipped with the tools to succeed in the 21st century. One key tool that develops skills necessary for success in any field is data science, and structured opportunities to pursue it at the undergraduate level and below are few and far between. </p>
									<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #138808"> How We're Bridging the Gap </p>
									<p> Above all, Data Science for India seeks to build community. We seek to accomplish this through several means. </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take advantage of Berkeley’s stellar technical programs with its commitment to social justice by developing a global community of passionate students who seek to use their skills for the greater good</li>
										<li>Build interest in data science among students in Indian universities through serving as a resource for students to learn more about the field, apply it to their own majors and personal projects, or even pursue it as an occupation </li>
										<li>Empower Indian students in secondary schools who have some mathematical knowledge by teaching them skills to understand and analyze data and by connecting them with students in universities</li>
										<li>Reach out to high-achieving high school and college students in India to form a dedicated base of volunteer teachers</li>
									</ul>
									<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #138808"> What We're Working On </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Developing technical modules, case studies, and projects on paper and in the Python programming language to be used by students with varied educational backgrounds, from undergraduates with programming experience to students in government schools with little to no knowledge of programming and statistics </li>
										<li>If schools do not have access to a computer, we will still teach lessons in the classroom, as data literacy is our objective. The programming exercises are meant as a complement to the conceptual lessons </li>
										<li> Connecting with students and faculty at various Indian institutions to establish data science-focused organizations to teach these modules to students with limited programming experience and pursue initiatives to raise interest in data science at their universities </li>
									</ul>
									<p style = "font-weight: bold; color: #138808"> Long Term Goals </p>
									<ul>
										<li> Connect with partners in the tech industry in both India and the US who share our vision of expanding access to a quality technical education </li>
										<li> Working with our partners at universities such as IIT Delhi and BITS Pilani to develop localized models for promoting data and technological<em> literacy </em> across India </li>
										<li> Exposing students with technical aptitude to more advanced concepts in fields such as machine learning </li>
										<li> Adapt our curriculum and outreach model to work with other nations to further our vision of a data literate society </li>
									</ul>
